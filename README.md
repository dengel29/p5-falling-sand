# p5-falling-sand

A falling sand implementation with p5. Uses the pixelArray to draw falling sand and sort according to simple falling sand logic. Inspired by Noita and ![Orb Farm](https://orb.farm/).

Plenty of other ways to improve on this that I hope to get to in the near future:

- [ ] Move sand logic out to a Grain class
- [ ] Build upon sand sorting logic to add water, gases, etc.
- [ ] Add rigid structures to guide substances, like an hourglass
- [ ] UI to switch between substances
